Model TODO List:


Model Future TODO List:
 ☐ Think about how hosr/hor may occupy multiple parcels
   [] Could keep track of neighboring parcels
   [] if an unoccupied parcel becomes available, have company make offer to neighbors
   [] company has larger budget/WTP
   [] property owner's WTA comes into play
 ☐ Add commercial land use changes
     [] dependent on population (seasonal and full time residents)
 ☐ Keep daily population changes in mind (e.g., day and night simulations)
 ☐ Setup distribution of number of hotel/apartment rooms for Seaside


Model Ideas:
 ☐ Paper presenting model/results
 ☐ Sensitivity analysis of model variables
 ☐ Validation and Verification of model
 ☐ Adaptation pathways; implementing polcies in sequence (Barnett et al., 2014)


Misc. Ideas:
 ☐ Think about an "education" alternative. 
     [] Could shift preferences (e.g., values) as new agents come in to model. 
     [] For example, educate future generations to put less value on living near the coast

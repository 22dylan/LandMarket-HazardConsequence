# Integrated Urban Change and Hazard Consequence Model

This repository cotains source code of an integrated urban change and hazard consequence model. The model is an Agent-Based Model (ABM). Urban change is simulated via agent-based modeling (ABM) and is written in Julia using [Agents.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/) (Datseris et al., 2022). [IN-CORE](https://incore.ncsa.illinois.edu) is used to model damage and losses resulting from natural hazards (van de Lindt et al., 2018).


A detailed model description is available here: https://22dylan.github.io/LandMarket-HazardConsequence/intro.html
